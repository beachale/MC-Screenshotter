Live panorama cubemap mod

It's a mod which auto-captures a panorama cubemap separate from the player pov, so you can keep playing and the panorama screenshots will be taken in the same place at whatever interval you choose.

Generates a local 360 cubemap viewer with vanilla cubemap comparison for easy recreation.
Essentially works like n00bbot, except it works entirely on the client side.

Supports custom resource packs, render distance, entities, player rendering and cubemap export.

Currently only made for 1.21 but other versions may be supported in the future.

Vibecoded, of course, but works fine. Message me if you find any bugs!
